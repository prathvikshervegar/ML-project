# MALL CUSTOMER SEGMENTATION
The main objective of our project is to study the dataset of Mall_Customers, 
which is the data of customers who visit the mall and spend there. Then we 
solve our targets by using unsupervised learning methods. 
By the end of this case study, you would be able to answer below questions.
  1. How to achieve customer segmentation using machine learning 
    algorithm (K-Means Clustering) in Python in simplest way.
  2. Who are your target customers with whom you can start marketing 
    strategy [easy to converse].
